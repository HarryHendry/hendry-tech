    <h1>Harry Hendry </h1>
    <p>  Hi, I’m Harry, a driven and versatile individual with a passion for building, improving, and learning.
This online profile is my way of showcasing the full range of transferable skills, education and experiences I've developed across the years. 
Rather than using a traditional CV or linkedin profile, I created a space where I can show who I am, what I can do, and the kind of value I bring to any team or project.
